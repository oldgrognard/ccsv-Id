1.  Introduction

   A CCSV (Control-Character-Separated Values file) is a file format
   that enables moving data between spreadsheets, statistical analysis
   programs, databases, and any other program that works with
   rectangular data.  It is very similar to (CSV) Comma-Separated Values
   files [RFC4180], (TSV) Tab-Separated Values files, and their
   derivatives.  Unlike those file types, the CCSV minimizes usage
   ambiguity by having non-printable characters as delimiters.  The two
   delimiter characters may not appear in the document's text, making
   the practice of escaping certain characters or adding additional
   delimiters for certain strings unnecessary.  This document seeks to
   define the format of Control Character Separated Values (CCSV) files
   and formally register the "text/ccsv" Media Type for CCSV in
   accordance with [RFC6838].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Definition of the CCSV format

   In order for a file to be a CCSV, it MUST adhere to the following
   formatting rules:

   1.  A Record Separator RS (U+001E) is used between each record in the
       file including the header.

   2.  A Unit Separator US (U+001F) is used between each field in a
       record.

   3.  A CCSV MUST begin with a header.  The header consists of the
       names of the columns separated with US (U+001F) entities.

   4.  The header is terminated with the RS (U+001E) entity if the
       document contains any records.

   5.  The header and each record MUST contain the same number of US
       (U+001F) entities i.e., the header and each record MUST have the
       same number of fields.

   6.  Each record in the body is delimited with a RS (U+001E) entity.
       Note that carriage returns and line feeds are not part of the
       delimiter and are valid characters in the body of a field.

   7.  Each field within a record is delimited with the US (U+001F)
       entity.

   8.  The US (U+001F) entity and the RS (U+001E) separator MUST NOT
       appear in the body of a field.

   The ABNF grammar [STD68] appears as follows:

   file = header RS *(record RS) [record]
   header = name *( US name )
   record = field *( US field )
   name = field
   field = *VCHAR
   VCHAR = %x21-7E ; visible characters
   RS = %x1E ; record separator
   US = %x1F ; unit separator
