1.  Introduction

   A CCSV (Control-Character-Separated Values file) is a file format
   that enables moving data between spreadsheets, statistical analysis
   programs, databases, and any other program that works with
   rectangular data.  It is very similar to (CSV) Comma-Separated Values
   files [RFC4180], (TSV) Tab-Separated Values files, and their
   derivatives.  Unlike those file types, the CCSV minimizes usage
   ambiguity by having non-printable characters as delimiters.  The two
   delimiter characters may not appear in the document's text, making
   the practice of escaping certain characters or adding additional
   delimiters for certain strings unnecessary.  This document seeks to
   define the format of Control Character Separated Values (CCSV) files
   and formally register the "text/ccsv" Media Type for CCSV in
   accordance with [RFC6838].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Definition of the CCSV format

   In order for a file to be a CCSV, it MUST adhere to the following
   formatting rules:

2.1.1.  Formatting Rules

   1.  The file MUST NOT begin with a Byte Order Mark (U+FEFF).

   2.  The file MUST use UTF-8 encoding.  Since US-ASCII is a subset of
       UTF-8, programs may create CCSV files with that encoding.  A
       consuming program may not be able to interpret all characters if
       it only works with US-ASCII and SHOULD work with UTF-8 if the
       source is unknown.

   3.  A Record Separator RS (U+001E) is used between each record in the
       file including the header.

   4.  A Unit Separator US (U+001F) is used between each field in a
       record.  Note that carriage returns and line feeds are not part
       of the delimiter and are valid characters in the body of a field.

   5.  A CCSV MUST begin with a header.  The header consists of the
       names of the columns separated with US (U+001F) entities.

   6.  The header is terminated with the RS (U+001E) entity if the
       document contains any records.

   7.  The header and each record, if any, MUST contain the same number
       of US (U+001F) entities i.e., the header and each record MUST
       have the same number of fields.

   8.  The US (U+001F) entity and the RS (U+001E) separator MUST NOT
       appear in the body of a field.

   The ABNF grammar [STD68] appears as follows:

file = header RS *(record RS) [record]
header = name *( US name )
record = field *( US field )
name = field
field = *VCHAR
VCHAR = %x00-1D / %x20-D7FF / %xE000-10FFFF ; all characters except the designated delimiters and surrogates
RS = %x1E ; record separator
US = %x1F ; unit separator

3.  Encoding Considerations

   CCSV files MUST be encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629].

   Implementations MUST NOT add a byte order mark (U+FEFF) to the
   beginning of the file or networked-transmitted text.

4.  Security Considerations

   CCSV files alone are considered relatively harmless as there is no
   additional prescribed processing.  However, the file may be parsed
   and further processed by the recipient.  To the extent that a
   receiving application executes arbitrary system level commands from
   strings contained in a CCSV file, they may be at risk.

5.  Interoperability Considerations

   Adherance to the Formatting Rules Section 2.1.1 and the Encoding
   Considerations Section 3 ensures a high level of interoperability.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides the media-type registration application (as per
   [RFC6838]).
